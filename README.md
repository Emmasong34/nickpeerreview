# Weekend Challenge 11 - React-Redux Feedback Form

## Instructions

Reviewing code is an important role developers play. We're going to practice reviewing code from others.

- Get the repo url from your partner
- Get your partner's project running on your computer
- Review the code from your partner and give relevant feedback
- Complete the Markdown section and submit that in the notes section on the assignment app. (Make sure you include who's code you reviewed.)

Practicing compassionate code reviews is important (you can learn more from this video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8EiIPZvh0 )

## Markdown

Hi Nick, 

Overall I think your code looks really good! I liked your use of radio buttons for the input as a way to limit the input numbers from one to five. Moving from page to page was seamless and the information was added to the database without any problems.

I would suggest adding more code comments and doing more git commits as you work through your project.

I really liked being able to see how you did four separate reducers in your redux store.

Thanks for letting me check out your code!
Emma
